    These are exclusions specific for Citrix
    <br />
    When using non-persistent images, all changes are lost after a reboot. This also applies to antivirus definitions
    and possible contaminations. Depending on the degree of security desired, a decision can be made as to whether it
    will be necessary to install an antivirus agent on the virtual desktop.
    The following antivirus exclusions should be applied to all Citrix infrastructure servers:
    <ul>
        <li>Set real-time scanning to scan local drives only and not network drives</li>
        <li>Disable scan on boot</li>
        <li>Remove any unnecessary antivirus related entries from the Run key</li>
        <li>Exclude the pagefile(s) from being scanned</li>
        <li>Exclude Windows event logs from being scanned</li>
        <li>Exclude IIS log files from being scanned</li>
        <li>Exclude the print spooler directory (to improve print performance)</li>
    </ul>
    It is recommended to update a master image or vDisk at least once a month, this is to keep the size of the virus
    definition files to a minimum. For updating only the definition files it of no importance how the image gets updated
    (vDisk version, editing a MCS image or enrolling an entirely new image).
    Applying the new definition files must occur during computer start-up and at a random interval during business hours
    (most virtualization aware anti-virus solutions provide such a function).
    Start-up of the Citrix services should be delayed to ensure enough time is available to update the definition files.
    This can be done by altering the service start-up method to 'delayed start', or by implementing a script to
    'manually' start the services after a period of time. Virus definitions sizes tent to increase over time, this
    timeframe must be taken into account.
